# StarClusterMixtureModel
Mixture model method for identifying subclusters of young stars in star-forming regions

The code has been published by [Kuhn et al. (2014, ApJ, 787, 107)](https://doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/787/2/107), which includes a vignette that provides a walk-through of how to run the code on real data. The method has also been used in several other studies including [this](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/aa9177) and [this](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/sty473). This code is also discussed in Chapter 19 "Applications in Astronomy" by Kuhn and Feigelson in the [Handbook of Mixture Analysis](https://www.crcpress.com/Handbook-of-Mixture-Analysis/Fruhwirth-Schnatter-Celeux-Robert/p/book/9781498763813), edited by Fruhwirth-Schnatter, Celeux, and Robert.
